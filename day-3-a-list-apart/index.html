          <p>1958: The skateboard is made from roller skates attached to a board.
          This is really where it all starts.
          As surfing becomes more popular, skating becomes a way
          to surf when there are no waves—"sidewalk surfing." 1959: "Roller Derby" mass produces
          a skateboard with metal wheels. The first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars.[5][6][7] The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today.[8] An American WAC, Betty Magnuson, reported seeing French children in the Montmartre section of Paris riding on boards with roller skate wheels attached to them in late 1944.</p>
